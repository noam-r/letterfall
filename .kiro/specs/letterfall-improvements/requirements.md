# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical performance, accessibility, and maintainability issues identified in the LetterFall word game. The improvements focus on optimizing bundle size, enhancing memory management, improving accessibility, and establishing better code quality practices to ensure a robust and inclusive gaming experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to load quickly and run smoothly on all devices, so that I can enjoy an uninterrupted gaming experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the initial bundle size SHALL be reduced by at least 40% from the current 511KB
2. WHEN the game runs for extended periods THEN memory usage SHALL remain stable without significant increases
3. WHEN letters are spawned and destroyed THEN all PixiJS objects and event listeners SHALL be properly cleaned up
4. WHEN the game transitions between states THEN there SHALL be no memory leaks or orphaned objects
5. IF the main bundle exceeds 300KB THEN code splitting SHALL be implemented to load non-critical features on demand

### Requirement 2: Error Handling and Resilience

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to handle errors gracefully and provide helpful feedback, so that technical issues don't prevent me from playing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN WebGL initialization fails THEN the game SHALL display a clear error message with fallback options
2. WHEN PixiJS encounters rendering errors THEN the application SHALL recover gracefully without crashing
3. WHEN network resources fail to load THEN appropriate fallback mechanisms SHALL be activated
4. WHEN JavaScript errors occur THEN error boundaries SHALL catch them and display user-friendly messages
5. IF audio files fail to load THEN the game SHALL continue functioning with visual feedback only

### Requirement 3: Accessibility Enhancement

**User Story:** As a player with disabilities, I want to be able to play the game using assistive technologies and keyboard navigation, so that I can enjoy the same gaming experience as other users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using a screen reader THEN all game elements SHALL have appropriate ARIA labels and descriptions
2. WHEN navigating with keyboard only THEN all interactive elements SHALL be accessible via tab navigation
3. WHEN letters fall THEN there SHALL be audio cues or alternative feedback for visually impaired users
4. WHEN the game state changes THEN screen readers SHALL announce important updates
5. IF reduced motion is enabled THEN animations SHALL be minimized while maintaining gameplay functionality

### Requirement 4: Mobile Experience Optimization

**User Story:** As a mobile player, I want touch interactions to be responsive and the interface to adapt to my device, so that I can play comfortably on any screen size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN touching falling letters THEN the touch response SHALL be immediate and accurate
2. WHEN the device orientation changes THEN the game layout SHALL adapt appropriately
3. WHEN playing on small screens THEN all UI elements SHALL remain accessible and properly sized
4. WHEN using touch gestures THEN they SHALL not conflict with browser navigation
5. IF the device has limited performance THEN the game SHALL automatically adjust quality settings

### Requirement 5: Code Quality and Maintainability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to be well-tested and maintainable, so that I can confidently add features and fix bugs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code changes are made THEN automated tests SHALL verify functionality remains intact
2. WHEN the Zustand store grows THEN it SHALL be split into focused, single-responsibility stores
3. WHEN components are created THEN they SHALL follow consistent patterns and be properly typed
4. WHEN bugs are reported THEN comprehensive logging SHALL help identify the root cause
5. IF test coverage drops below 80% THEN the build process SHALL fail until coverage is restored

### Requirement 6: Resource Management

**User Story:** As a player on a limited data plan, I want the game to efficiently manage resource loading, so that I don't consume unnecessary bandwidth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN only essential resources SHALL be loaded initially
2. WHEN switching topics THEN topic-specific resources SHALL be loaded on demand
3. WHEN audio is muted THEN audio files SHALL not be downloaded
4. WHEN the browser supports it THEN resources SHALL be cached for offline play
5. IF network conditions are poor THEN the game SHALL adapt by reducing resource quality

### Requirement 7: Development Experience

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear development tools and processes, so that I can efficiently debug issues and add new features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN debugging the game THEN comprehensive logging SHALL be available in development mode
2. WHEN running tests THEN they SHALL execute quickly and provide clear feedback
3. WHEN building for production THEN the process SHALL include automated quality checks
4. WHEN errors occur THEN source maps SHALL provide accurate debugging information
5. IF performance issues arise THEN profiling tools SHALL help identify bottlenecks
